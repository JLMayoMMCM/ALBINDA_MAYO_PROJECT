# ALBINDA_MAYO_PROJECT_DEMO

### INTRODUCTION
This project was created by **James Albert S. Albinda** and **Jonathan Lance S. Mayo** as a project for **IT102L W5**. The goal is to develop an **ATM console application** as a basic demonstration of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

### PROGRAM INTRODUCTION
The project consists of several **.CS** files, each responsible for different functionalities within the ATM system:

- **Account.cs**: Defines the structure for creating an account object, with **Cardholder** as a child class.
- **Account_Creation.cs**: Handles the account creation process.
- **ATM.cs**: Implements the core functionalities of the ATM console, including withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks.
- **ATM_INITIATION.cs**: Manages data import and the initiation of card insertion.
- **CardHolder.cs**: Defines the creation of an object based on the personal information of the user.
- **Program.cs**: The main entry point of the application. It allows users to create an account or initiate the ATM functionality.

### FEATURES
- **Account Creation**: Create new bank accounts with personal information.
- **Card Insertion**: Access Card info by inserting corresponding Card numbers.
- **Deposit/Withdraw**: Perform banking operations such as deposits and withdrawals.
- **Balance Check**: Verify the account balance with PIN validation.
- **Bill Payment**: Pay bills using the available balance in the account.
- **Change Pin**: Change the Account pin inside the console.
- **Data Manipulation**: Import, update, and store data live.
- **Pin Validation**: Includes security checks such as PIN validation and account lock after incorrect PIN attempts.
